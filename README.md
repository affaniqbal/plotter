# Plotter

A simple-to-use Python package which allows scientific researchers to make use of Python to plot scientific which has an x,y format using Python.

Please ensure you make a new Python environment via your package manager. If you need help to do this, I'm happy to guide via email or jump onto a zoom call, contact me at ani24@cam.ac.uk.

To install the scientific-data-plotter package via PyPi, run the following command in your terminal:

pip install scientific-data-plotter

Once the package is installed, you can run the plot.py script by navigating to the directory where the script is located and running the following command in your terminal:

python plot.py

After running the plot.py script, you will be prompted to select a csv file containing your data. Once you have selected the file, a dialog window will open up where you can customize your plot. You can change the axes ranges, axes titles, figure title, plotting style, colours, and switch between linear and log plots. Once you have made your desired changes, click on the "Plot" button to generate your plot.
